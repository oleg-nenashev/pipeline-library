<p>
    Builds a Jenkins plugin using Gradle.
</p>
<p>
    The implementation follows the standard build/test/archive pattern. 
    Note that the Gradle flow for Jenkins plugins offers less functionality than the Maven flow,
    some key features are not supported: Incrementals - JEP-305, standard static analysis flows, etc.
    The current version also does not allow configuring the <code>jenkinsVersion</code>.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Usage.</b> The method can be used in the same way as <code>buildPlugin()</code> for Maven projects.
    See the documentation in the README of the Pipeline Library repository.
    Some parameters may not be supported at the moment, see the Pipeline code.
